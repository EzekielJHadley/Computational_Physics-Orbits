Computational_Physics-Orbits
=========================================

This was an assignment in my Computational Physics class on understanding time integration and solving
time dependent differential equations. The project was done completely in C with standard C libraries. 
I have the initial position and velocities of each planet in our solar system, found off of the NASA
website, and shows that the classical laws of gravity I get a stable orbit for all the planets. To check
the accuracy I looked up the position and velocities of each planet on my birthday and integrated till the
present date and compared my results with the actual data found on the NASA website. Lastly the code
demonstrates orbital procession of Mercury with and without corrections due to General relativity.
